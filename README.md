ttasm
=====

A TTF assembler. In Haskell!

ttasm is intended to provide a very, very flexible high-level assembler for making TTF fonts. It is designed to make it easy to make intentionally invalid files, but fairly difficult to write accidentally invalid ones.

It is currently very much in development. No really, don't use this.
